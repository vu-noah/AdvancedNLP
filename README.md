This repository contains the following file:
- extract.features.py: a script that extracts features from a piece of text. 

The features implemented here were selected based on an initial literature review on Semantic Role Labeling and other NLP tasks that use syntactic features.
They include features derived from a dependency parser (e.g. the head of a target word, dependents of a target word, path lenght) as well as from a constituency parser (e.g. the full constituent of a target word, the path to the closest VP)
